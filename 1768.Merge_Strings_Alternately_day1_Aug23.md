# Pseudo Code

1. compare two strings
2. start add from word1's index and add word2's index
3. if word1 is the shortest, add the rest of word2
4. if word2 is the shortest, add the rest of word1

```typescript
function mergeAlternately(word1: string, word2: string): string {
    let merged = ''
    if (word1.length < word2.length) {
        for (let i = 0; i < word1.length; i++) {
            merged += word1[i] + word2[i]
        }
        // slice(start,end) end before last index
        merged = merged + word2.slice(word1.length, word2.length)
    }
    else {
        for (let i = 0; i < word2.length; i++) {
            merged += word1[i] + word2[i]
        }
        merged = merged + word1.slice(word2.length, word1.length)
    }
    return merged
```

# Pseudo Code

1. compare two strings
2. set short and long to word1 or word2
3. reuse the code

```typescript
function mergeAlternately(word1: string, word2: string): string {
  let merged = "";
  let short = word1;
  let long = word2;
  if (word1.length > word2.length) {
    short = word2;
    long = word1;
  }
  // loop the shortest string length
  for (let i = 0; i < short.length; i++) {
    merged += word1[i] + word2[i];
  }
  // it always slice start from the short.length(index) to long.length(index)
  merged = merged + long.slice(short.length, long.length);
  return merged;
}
```

```python
def mergeAlternately(word1, word2):
    merged = ""
    short = word1
    long = word2
  if (len(word1) > len(word2):
    short = word2;
    long = word1;

  # loop the short string's index
  for i in range(len(short)):
    merged += word1[i] + word2[i];

  merged = merged + long[len(short):]
  return merged;
```

# Improvements:

indentation and space in between

```JavaScript
/**
 * @param {string} word1
 * @param {string} word2
 * @return {string}
 */
var mergeAlternately = function(word1, word2) {
    let merged ='';
    let short = word1;
    let long = word2;

    if (word1.length > word2.length){
        long = word1;
        short = word2;
    }

    let i = 0;
    while (i < short.length) {
        merged += word1[i] + word2[i];
        i++
    }

    // merged += long.slice(short.length, long.length)
    while (i < long.length) {
        merged += long[i];
        i++;
    }

    return merged
};
```
